**Problem**: It is a multi-class classification problem, and here classesÂ 0 to 9 refer to it as a T-shirt or top, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots, respectively. The optimal categorization model will then be identified by comparing the outputs of the two models. 

Ann and CNN are used to make predictions using Tensorflow. We also explored the Pytorch framework and bit more newer model Compact Convolutional Transformer.
